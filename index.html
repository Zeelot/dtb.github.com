		<p>
			Hi! I'm David. I go by notJim on the internet. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This is my place where I put random stuff I'm playing around with. It turns out that
			pushing to a git remote is a lot easier than SFTPing into my VPN.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may have guessed that I'm a web developer. In the past few years, I've written MVC applications
			in PHP and now in C#. Go ahead and ask me which I prefer.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm currently very interested in interaction design and UX, as well as API design and security.
		</p>
		<h2>Recently</h2>
		<p>
			I'm currently working at <a href="http://thinkecoinc.com">ThinkEco</a> on our web-powered energy-efficiency
			product (an outlet that helps you save power). If you've never written a web app that interfaces with 
			hardware, you're missing out.
		</p>
		<p>
			At ThinkEco, my work involves designing user-friendly, gracefully-degrading user interfaces, as well as
			our REST API. 
		</p>
		<h2>On the side</h2>
		<p>
			When I'm not at work, I listen to music and play Starcraft II. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I've also been trying to come up with a way to draw beautiful fractal trees that sway in a gentle breeze. 
			As it turns out, this is actually pretty frustrating.
