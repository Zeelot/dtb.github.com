		<h1>David Thomas Bernal</h1>
		<p>
			I am a web developer living in New York City. I like programming, music, and minimalism.
		</p>
		<h2>Articles</h2>
		<p>
			Every now and then, I write an article. Here are the most-recent five:
		</p>
		<ul id="posts">
			{% for post in site.posts limit:5 %}
			<li>
				<span class="date">{{ post.date | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</span>
				<a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
			</li>
			{% endfor %}
		</ul>
		<p id="allposts">
			<a href="archive.html">all articles</a>
		</p>
		<h2>At work</h2>
		<p>
			I'm currently working at <a href="http://thinkecoinc.com">ThinkEco</a>, working on our 
			web-driven energy-saving power outlet. At ThinkEco I work on the full stack, moving comfortably from 
			writing C# on top of ASP.Net MVC to javascript and CSS.
			Recently, my work involves designing user-friendly, gracefully-degrading user interfaces, as well as
			our REST API. 
		</p>
		<h2>On the side</h2>
		<p>
			I've been trying to come up with a way to draw beautiful fractal trees that sway in a gentle breeze. 
			As it turns out, this is actually pretty frustrating.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I'm not programming, I listen to music and play Starcraft II.
